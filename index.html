        <p>This is very much a work in progress.</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>A fractal architecture is an application architecture based on intercommunicating, loosely-coupled, repeating and self-contained units.</p>

<h1>Maxims</h1>

<ol>
<li>Decentralized over centralized</li>
<li>Local over global</li>
<li>Verbs over nouns</li>
</ol><h1>Tenets</h1>

<h2>State</h2>

<p>State is a necessary evil. It gets progressively worse as its scope increases, doubly so if it is mutable. However, pretending it simply doesn't exist is impractical.</p>

<p>A fractal architecture embraces, contains and limits state.</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>

<p>Since a fractal architecture-based application is effectively a number of bubbles of state communicating with each other, remote procedure calls end up making a lot more sense than representational state transfer.</p>

<p>This is in essence very similar to the actor model of concurrency. Actors are typically smaller than the shards in a fractal architecture: the things being promoted to first class citizens are closer to E's vats than E's objects.</p>

<h1>Benefits</h1>

<h2>Data locality</h2>

<p>It's hard to compete with the performance, particularly the latency, of a small, local SQLite database.</p>

<h2>Cost</h2>

<h2>Scalability</h2>

<p>Few things scale down better than local SQLite databases.</p>

<h1>Downsides</h1>

<h2>Complexities of a distributed system</h2>

<h2>Unfamiliarity and lack of tooling</h2>

<p>Because this is not the de facto standard, there is significantly less existing work to fall back on.</p>

<p>Most people are afraid of the unfamiliar.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>A myriad of tools can be used to accomplish these tasks, but some are more naturally suited to it than others. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>SQLite is a fantastic data store for use cases where you have a large number of small and mobile databases. It's highly performant to boot.</li>
<li>Event-loop based systems tend to be better suited to the high level of inter-node communication. The author has had personal successes with Twisted, which comes with an implementation nice full-duplex RPC mechanism called AMP, and a distributed computing/remote objects system called Perspective Broker.</li>
</ul><h1>Further reading</h1>

<p>The author has given <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w75TAXYZnNs">a presentation at PyCon ZA</a> on this subject.</p>
